There was an issue with a unit test on Mac with the previous version. I 
definitely don't understand why this test fails on Mac. So I skip this test 
on Mac.

## Testing environments

- local R 4.1.2 installation, Windows 10
- win-builder
- Ubuntu 20, via Github action
- mac-builder


## R CMD check results

OK.
